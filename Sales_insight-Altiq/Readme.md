## Business Problem
AltiQ Hardware is a company with numerous branches in India that provides computer hardware and peripheral manufacturers to its clients. The company's sales director is having a difficult time comprehending how the business is operating and what problems the company is currently experiencing because sales are not as projected and are rapidly falling. 

And whenever he calls the regional managers to acquire the current situation of the sales and market, these people, as is human nature, sugar-coat the truth and provide tonnes of Excel files instead of giving the truth, which irritated the sales director even more. Humans are not used to consuming numbers from excel files, which is why they are frustrated.

## Solution
As a data analyst, one answer to the sales director's challenge at AltiQ hardware would be to use BI dashboards to aid with data visualisation and analysis. The sales director can use a dashboard that pulls data from many sources, such as the company's sales data, market trends, and regional manager reports. The dashboard allows the sales director to easily see the current state of the business, identify issue areas, and make data-driven choices.

By providing a clear, visual depiction of the data, the sales director may avoid depending on Excel files and sugar-coated reports from regional managers, which can lead to misunderstandings and frustration.
