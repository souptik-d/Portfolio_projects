## Business Problem
AtliQ Hardware, which has various outlets across India, delivers computer hardware and peripheral manufacturers to its clients. The company's HR department is having difficulty monitoring employee attendance and finding trends of absenteeism. They require a thorough view of all employees' attendance records, including the number of leaves taken and the reasons for absence.
